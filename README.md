# Let's Build a Compiler

Based on the original series ["Letâ€™s Build a Compiler!"](https://compilers.iecc.com/crenshaw) by [Jack Crenshaw](https://jackcrenshaw.com/).

This is an adaptation of the original series to Kotlin. At a second stage the compiler will be further adapted to produce code for the TI-59 Texas Instruments Programmable Calculator.

At the moment the repository is split based on the chapters of the tutorial and will be updated as new chapters are added.
