# Let's Build a Compiler

Based on the original series ["Letâ€™s Build a Compiler!"](https://compilers.iecc.com/crenshaw) by [Jack Crenshaw](https://jackcrenshaw.com/).

This is an adaptation of the original series to Kotlin. Jack's series was written for the M68000 microprocessor. 
This adaptation will produce code for x86-64 architecture that the reader can easily execute on Linux - Chapter 10 onwards.

As part of this series, a new Programming Language is defined: **TINSEL** - Chapter 8 onwards.
Full BNF definition of TINSEL [here](TINSEL_BNF.MD). TINSEL program example [here](example1.tnsl)

The repository is split, based on the chapters of the tutorial and will be updated as new chapters are added.
