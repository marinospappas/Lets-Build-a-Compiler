# Let's Build a Compiler

Based on the original series ["Letâ€™s Build a Compiler!"](https://compilers.iecc.com/crenshaw) by [Jack Crenshaw](https://jackcrenshaw.com/).

This is an adaptation of the original series to Kotlin. Jack's series was written for the M68000 microprocessor. This adaptation will produce code for x86-64 that the reader can easily execute on Linux.

At the moment the repository is split based on the chapters of the tutorial and will be updated as new chapters are added.
